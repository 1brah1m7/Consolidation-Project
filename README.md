# Tuple Out!
## Description
The object of the game is to score the most points, or to be the first to reach a certain score. <br>
• Players take turns rolling dice to score points, as described below.<br>
• Each turn, the active player rolls three dice:<br>
– If all three dice are rolled with the same number, the player has “tupled out”, and ends their
turn with zero points. (For example, rolling three “4”s at the same time.) <br>
– If two dice have the same value, they are “fixed”, and they cannot be re-rolled. <br>
– During their turn, the player can re-roll any dice that are not “fixed”, as often as they would
like, until they decide to stop, or until they “tuple out” (get three of the same number). <br>
• When a player decides to stop, they score points equal to the total of the three dice, and then
their turn ends. <br>
• If a player “tuples out”, their turn ends and they score 0 points for that turn
